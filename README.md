# gateway

This is a Gateway Service - application intended to be part of a microservice architecture.

Part of [Aglomer](https://github.com/users/kanataidarov/projects/1) project.

The application has following features:

- It uses [Zuul](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul) to access backend microservices.
- It has ReactTS frontend that implements all CRUD logic for [Storage microservice](https://gitlab.com/aglomer/storage/).
- The application is configured for Service Discovery and Configuration with the JHipster-Registry. On launch, it will refuse to start if it is not able to connect to the JHipster-Registry at [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761). For more information on the JHipster Registry, read documentation on [https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/](https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

If you are using redis as a cache, you will have to launch a cache server.
To start your cache server, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/redis.yml up -d
```

The cache can also be turned off by adding to the application yaml:

```
spring:
    cache:
        type: none
```

See [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-caching.html#boot-features-caching-provider-none) for details.

**WARNING**: If you using second level hibernate cache and disabling the spring cache, you have to disable the second level hibernate cache as well since they are using
the same CacheManager.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew -x webpack
    npm start

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the gateway application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.jar

Then navigate to [http://localhost:12103](http://localhost:12103) in your browser.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod -Pwar clean bootWar

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    npm test

### Code quality

Cloud based [Sonar](https://sonarcloud.io/) is used to analyse code quality.

You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Also you can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the gradle plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```

## Using Docker for simple deployment (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jibDockerBuild

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

## Continuous Integration (optional)

The application structure fully supports CI pipeline for popular Continuous Integration systems (GitLab, GitHub, etc.).

GitLab CI configuration already included. For more information refer to [GitLab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/).
